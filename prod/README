The app layer comprehends all the application and user focused layer, it makes use and depends on the work of the 
edge data acquisition and fog data transformation and loading to the applicationd database.
The fog layer comprehends the mqtt broker and data loader and face recognition service

It is called fog layer because it serves a bridging or support layer between the edge (arduino and hardware level)
and the app layer.


The edge layer includes the arduino and sensor data acquisition layer


Altogether, the last entity in each layer is the first in the next layer

 sensor -> arduino -> mqtt -> worker/loader -> database -> api -> api-client
