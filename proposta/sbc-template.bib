abstract = {Objectives
Smart Scales are electronic scales that can store and track data (weights) with the ability to send data to an internet based portal. This data could go to the Health Care Provider (HCP) to help with weight management. It is known that patients that weigh frequently (more than once a week vs. weekly or monthly) will lose more weight than patients who do not.The objective is to determine if patients are willing to weigh daily and use a smart scale that would transmit their weight to their HCP.
Methods
A questionnaire was given to 100 consecutive primary care health insured patients willing to answer questions about usual practices of weighing (daily, weekly, monthly), whether the patient owns a scale, would they be willing to weigh daily, would they use a smart scale, would they be willing to share this data with their HCP, and would they purchase such a scale.
Results
Demographics: the average BMI was 28.4, 84% female, 18% of patients age 18 to 39.9 years of age, 35% age 40–64.9, 47% age 65 or higher. 48% were Caucasian, 31% Hispanic, 21% Asian, 4% African American (several patients identified with more than one race). 85% of patients owned a scale. 70% of patients weigh themselves at home. 25% weight less than once a month. 69% weight monthly or more, 41% weigh weekly or more, and 20% weigh daily (or most days of the week). Questionnaire answers: 72% of the patients would be willing to use a smart scale. 66% of patients would be willing to weigh daily and 65% of patients are willing to have this data communicated to their HCP. 54% of patients would not be willing to buy a smart scale and of those willing to buy a smart scale the price would need to be between $45 and $30 US dollars for the majority of the patients. 2% felt they could not afford a smart scale.
Conclusions
Health care is changing towards more telemedicine for appropriate disease states. Obesity or weight management may be ideal for this type of health care. Frequent self-weighing with a smart scale would be a good fit in this setting. This study shows that the majority of patients do not weigh frequently, but would be willing to weigh daily, and have this data transmitted to their HCP. Unfortunately just over half (54%) of the patients would not be willing to buy a smart scale and 2% cannot afford a smart scale.
Funding Sources
None.}

abstract = {The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is a specific field within Internet of Things (IoT) that focuses on the incorporation of IoT technology in healthcare solutions. The integration of intelligent devices, sensors, and diagnostic equipment brings about a revolutionary change in healthcare by effectively addressing its unique requirements and possibilities, thereby migrating from the IoT to the IoMT. In this chapter, the current state of the art in the field of intelligent healthcare is reviewed, with an emphasis on the development of future wireless networks. This article discusses the several domains in which the IoMT might be utilized, the potential trajectories it may follow in the future, and the enhancements that can be implemented in devices within this field. It discusses the potential of the IoMT to revolutionize healthcare provision on topics such as the integration of artificial intelligence, cross-device compatibility, enhanced security protocols, and so on. It addresses the IoMT’s critical role in remote patient monitoring and telemedicine. It also highlights the benefits of predictive maintenance, patient engagement, and empowerment.}

abstract = {In this thesis, we plan to introduce a new IoT app development framework named Peekaboo, which aims to make it much easier for developers to get the granularity of data they actually need rather than always requesting raw data, while also offering architecture support for building privacy features across all the apps. Peekaboo's architectural design philosophy is to factor out repetitive data pre-processing tasks (e.g., face detection, frequency spectrum extraction) from the cloud side onto a user-controlled hub, and support them as a fixed set of open source, reusable, and chainable operators. These operators pre-process raw data to remove unneeded sensitive user information before the data flow to the cloud (and out of the users' control), thus reducing data egress and many potential privacy risks for users. Further, all the IoT apps built with Peekaboo share a common structure of the chainable operators, making it possible to build consistent privacy features beyond individual apps.},

The following sections concentrate on software solutions and components of smart home management systems, related communication technologies, and issues of privacy and security associated with the connected nature of modern smart homes. A separate section presents current challenges of smart home technologies and their dispersion, and points to some interesting solutions and future trends.}
