abstract = {Objectives
Smart Scales are electronic scales that can store and track data (weights) with the ability to send data to an internet based portal. This data could go to the Health Care Provider (HCP) to help with weight management. It is known that patients that weigh frequently (more than once a week vs. weekly or monthly) will lose more weight than patients who do not.The objective is to determine if patients are willing to weigh daily and use a smart scale that would transmit their weight to their HCP.
Methods
A questionnaire was given to 100 consecutive primary care health insured patients willing to answer questions about usual practices of weighing (daily, weekly, monthly), whether the patient owns a scale, would they be willing to weigh daily, would they use a smart scale, would they be willing to share this data with their HCP, and would they purchase such a scale.
Results
Demographics: the average BMI was 28.4, 84% female, 18% of patients age 18 to 39.9 years of age, 35% age 40–64.9, 47% age 65 or higher. 48% were Caucasian, 31% Hispanic, 21% Asian, 4% African American (several patients identified with more than one race). 85% of patients owned a scale. 70% of patients weigh themselves at home. 25% weight less than once a month. 69% weight monthly or more, 41% weigh weekly or more, and 20% weigh daily (or most days of the week). Questionnaire answers: 72% of the patients would be willing to use a smart scale. 66% of patients would be willing to weigh daily and 65% of patients are willing to have this data communicated to their HCP. 54% of patients would not be willing to buy a smart scale and of those willing to buy a smart scale the price would need to be between $45 and $30 US dollars for the majority of the patients. 2% felt they could not afford a smart scale.
Conclusions
Health care is changing towards more telemedicine for appropriate disease states. Obesity or weight management may be ideal for this type of health care. Frequent self-weighing with a smart scale would be a good fit in this setting. This study shows that the majority of patients do not weigh frequently, but would be willing to weigh daily, and have this data transmitted to their HCP. Unfortunately just over half (54%) of the patients would not be willing to buy a smart scale and 2% cannot afford a smart scale.

	abstract = {Load cells have long been used to sense and measure force and torque. When properly designed and used, they are very accurate and reliable sensors. Load cells are applied in several different fields, usually for weighing measurements. Among many other things, food, vehicles, and animals are weighed daily with load cells. The gripper of a robotic arm that picks up an object can be equipped with load cells in order to provide compression force feedback to the control system to prevent the object from being damaged or released too early. Also, load cells can be used to sense the compression forces during a robot's walk to provide data for the equilibrium-controlling system. In industrial machinery, rods, beams, wheels and bars are instrumented in order to check the forces exerted on them. The volume or level of a tank can be measured indirectly by means of a load cell that monitors the total weight. Lift units can also have a load's total weight measured to prevent overload. Because of such a variety of possible applications, load cells are very important. This paper describes some of the theory and practice of load cells, including their basic elements and the electronics necessary for measurement. As an application example, the development of a 3-ring spherical load cell is presented which can be used to measure compression forces on fruit during storage and transportation is presented.},

Vaughn Vernon couples guided approaches to implementation with modern architectures, highlighting the importance and value of focusing on the business domain while balancing technical considerations.   Building on Eric Evans’ seminal book, Domain-Driven Design, the author presents practical {DDD} techniques through examples from familiar domains. Each principle is backed up by realistic Java examples–all applicable to C\# developers–and all content is tied together by a single case study: the delivery of a large-scale Scrum-based {SaaS} system for a multitenant environment.   The author takes you far beyond “{DDD}-lite” approaches that embrace {DDD} solely as a technical toolset, and shows you how to fully leverage {DDD}’s “strategic design patterns” using Bounded Context, Context Maps, and the Ubiquitous Language. Using these techniques and examples, you can reduce time to market and improve quality, as you build software that is more flexible, more scalable, and more tightly aligned to business goals.   Coverage includes  Getting started the right way with {DDD}, so you can rapidly gain value from it Using {DDD} within diverse architectures, including Hexagonal, {SOA}, {REST}, {CQRS}, Event-Driven, and Fabric/Grid-Based Appropriately designing and applying Entities–and learning when to use Value Objects instead Mastering {DDD}’s powerful new Domain Events technique Designing Repositories for {ORM}, {NoSQL}, and other databases},

Peekaboo's architectural design philosophy is to factor out repetitive data pre-processing tasks (e.g., face detection, frequency spectrum extraction) from the cloud side onto a user-controlled hub, and support them as a fixed set of open source, reusable, and chainable operators. These operators pre-process raw data to remove unneeded sensitive user information before the data flow to the cloud (and out of the users' control), thus reducing data egress and many potential privacy risks for users. Further, all the IoT apps built with Peekaboo share a common structure of the chainable operators, making it possible to build consistent privacy features beyond individual apps.},

	abstract = {With the proliferation of IoT cameras, it is possible to use crowdsourced videos to help find interested targets (e.g., crime suspect, lost child, lost vehicle) on demand. Due to the ubiquity of IoT cameras such as dash mounted and phone cameras, the crowdsourced videos have much better spatial coverage compared to only using surveillance cameras, and, thus, can significantly improve the effectiveness of target search. However, this may raise privacy concerns when workers (owners of IoT cameras) are provided with photos of the target. Also, the videos captured by the workers may be misused to track bystanders. To address this problem, we design and implement TargetFinder, a privacy preserving system for target search through IoT cameras. By exploiting homomorphic encryption techniques, the server can search for the target on encrypted information. We also propose techniques to allow the requester (e.g., the police) to receive images that include the target, while all other captured images of the bystanders are not revealed. Moreover, the target’s face image is not revealed to the server and the participating workers. Due to the high computation overhead of the cryptographic primitives, we develop optimization techniques in order to run our privacy preserving protocol on mobile devices. We also formulate and solve a worker selection problem to maximize the probability of finding the target under some budget constraint. A real-world demo and extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of TargetFinder.},

	abstract = {In this thesis, we plan to introduce a new IoT app development framework named Peekaboo, which aims to make it much easier for developers to get the granularity of data they actually need rather than always requesting raw data, while also offering architecture support for building privacy features across all the apps. Peekaboo's architectural design philosophy is to factor out repetitive data pre-processing tasks (e.g., face detection, frequency spectrum extraction) from the cloud side onto a user-controlled hub, and support them as a fixed set of open source, reusable, and chainable operators. These operators pre-process raw data to remove unneeded sensitive user information before the data flow to the cloud (and out of the users' control), thus reducing data egress and many potential privacy risks for users. Further, all the IoT apps built with Peekaboo share a common structure of the chainable operators, making it possible to build consistent privacy features beyond individual apps.},

Now, we are witnessing the advent of the complex IoT (Internet of Things) era, where not only people, but also all devices on the planet are interconnected to each other and enormous amount of interactions is required. In this paper, we propose HePA (Hexagonal Platform Architecture), a platform architecture that is extremely scalable while maintaining required performance and reflecting requirements of the complex environment. We expect the HePA to become a reference architecture in this field.},

	abstract = {In the bustling streets of Pakistan, small-scale fruits and vegetables shops stand as vital hubs of daily life. These humble establishments are where people flock to satisfy their everyday needs. However, the traditional methods employed by shopkeepers using manual weighing scales have proven to be time-consuming and limit the shopkeepers’ ability to serve multiple customers simultaneously. But in a world rapidly embracing automation and propelled by the wonders of artificial intelligence, a revolution is underway. In this visionary paper, we introduce the concept of an intelligent scale that will revolutionize the retail process. This remarkable scale possesses the power to automate numerous tasks, making the shopping experience seamless and efficient. Imagine a scale that not only determines the weight of the produce but also possesses the ability to detect and identify each fruit and vegetable placed upon it. By harnessing the potential of cutting-edge technology, we fine-tuned pre-trained models, such as YOLOv5n and YOLOv7, on our extensive dataset, consisting of 12 classes and 2622 images. The dataset was collected manually and it closely aligns with real-time scenarios, ensuring that the distribution in our training and validation sets were similar and that it reflected what our models will encounter during testing. As a result, our YOLOv5n and YOLOv7 models have achieved astonishing mean Average Precision (mAP) scores of 0.98 and 0.987, respectively. YOLOv5n demonstrates an impressive processing speed of 20 frames per second (fps) on a CPU, while it reaches an impressive 125 fps on a GPU. Similarly, YOLOv7 achieves a processing speed of 2 fps on a CPU, which escalates to 66.6 fps on a GPU. These extraordinary results testify to the remarkable accuracy and efficacy of our system when subjected to real-world testing scenarios. To ensure accurate weighing, we incorporated a load cell with an hx711 amplifier, providing precise measurements that customers can trust. However, our intelligent scale does not stop there. We understand that determining weight alone is insufficient when it comes to transactions. Hence, a meticulously crafted Python script was developed to map each specific item to its corresponding price based on its weight. With all these incredible features in place, the experience of purchasing from a fruits and vegetables shop is taken to new heights. The intelligent scale is accompanied by a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI), where customers can conveniently view their order and prices. Once the order is complete, a simple click on the print button generates a neatly printed bill, ensuring a seamless transaction. The implications of this intelligent scale are profound. Shopkeepers can now serve customers faster and more efficiently, effortlessly managing multiple transactions simultaneously. The introduction of automation enhances the overall shopping experience, leaving customers delighted and eager to return. This amalgamation of technology and traditional commerce heralds a new era, where small-scale shops can thrive and adapt to the ever-evolving needs of the modern world.},

The prototype presented in this paper can function as a standalone system (e.g industrial weighting machine) or as part of a larger multilevel biometric system. The design uses load cells as it's primary input sensors. Eight load cells were used to build the prototype sensing platform. When weight is placed on the platform, the change in resistance of the load cells are recorded as analog signals which are fed into an amplifier and then to an Arduino microprocessor for data processing, data analyzing and data representation.The whole system can be powered by a 9V battery or solar energy. Between 5kg to 20kg of static weights and 10 individuals of varying age groups, gender, weight and foot sizes were used for testing the precision and accuracy of the sensing platform.},

	abstract = {Obesity is a growing health concern in Indonesia, with its prevalence steadily increasing and contributing to a variety of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. One effective way to monitor and manage body weight is by regularly calculating the Body Mass Index (BMI). This study aims to develop a digital weighing scale prototype based on the Internet of Things (IoT), equipped with BMI calculation and real-time weight tracking features. The prototype utilizes load cell sensors, HX711, ESP8266, and an OLED display for measuring weight, which is then transmitted to a Flutter-based application (MyWeightApp) connected to Firebase for data storage and graphical visualization. The research adopts the waterfall model for system development, encompassing requirements analysis, planning, modeling, construction, and system handover. Hardware testing demonstrates an accuracy rate of 0.78\% error, well below the 5\% tolerance threshold. Software testing using black-box testing confirms that the application successfully tracks weight, calculates BMI, and provides effective weight progress graphs. The results of this study indicate that the IoT-based digital weighing scale prototype developed can serve as a practical solution for obesity prevention and health monitoring in Indonesia.},
